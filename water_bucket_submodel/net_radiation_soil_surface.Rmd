##Based on Lu, Ren and Gong 2007. Held up by the fact that I can't understand the Fourier equation and the derivation method for heat transfer. 

alpha_param <- list(coarse = 0.96, fine = 0.27)
theta_sat <- 0.4
theta<- seq(0.0, 0.4, 0.01)
s_r <- theta/theta_sat
K_e <- exp(a_param$coarse*(1-s_r^(a_param$coarse-1.33)))
a_param <- 0.56
b_param <- 0.51 
porosity = theta_sat
lambda_dry = -a_param*porosity + b_param
lambda_sat = (lambda_s^(1-n))*(lambda_w^n)
lambda_s = (lambda_q^q)*(lambda_o^(1-q))
lambda_q = 

plot(lambda_dry~porosity)

```
